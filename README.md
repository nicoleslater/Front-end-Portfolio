Title: Nicole's News Update

API: News API 

As a part of this project I will design a site for people who want to stay up to date in news with the following categories: General News, Technology, Sports, Business and Entertainment. 


Pages for Deployment: 

1. Contact: http://127.0.0.1:5500/Contacts/contact.html - You will see a contact form where you can share feedback. 
2. Profile: http://127.0.0.1:5500/Profile/profile.html - You will see a registration form that requires Name and Email Address. 
3. Home: http://127.0.0.1:5500/Home/home.html - At this homepage you will be able to navigate through General News, Business, Technology, Sports and Entertainmet. 

I added a Google Search bar for any client that wants to search for an article.
